# PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

For our "Better Weather" Alexa Skill, we detect the zip code registered to your Alexa device each time you invoke the skill.

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We may use the information we collect from you when you sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or use certain other site features.

      • To personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.

      • To send periodic emails.

      • To tailor your experience for your geographic area.

### HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted in transit via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

### DO WE USE 'COOKIES'?

We do not use cookies for tracking purposes

### THIRD-PARTY DISCLOSURE

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety. 

Currently we use Squarespace (privacy policy) for site hosting and Mailchimp (privacy policy) for email processing.

### HOW DOES OUR SITE HANDLE DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS?

We cannot be sure to honor Do Not Track signals, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place because our site is hosted by Squarespace, which may not honor those signals.

### DOES OUR SITE ALLOW THIRD-PARTY BEHAVIORAL TRACKING?

While we don't directly allow third-party behavioral tracking, it is possible that our website host does.

### COPPA (CHILDREN ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT)

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old on this site.

### FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify you via email as soon as we are aware and able.

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

### CAN SPAM ACT

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
 

We collect your email address in order to:

      • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions


To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:

      • Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.

      • Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.

      • Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.

      • Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.

      • Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.

      • Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.


If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, simply follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
